# Sales-report using Power-BI

 Power BI is a powerful data visualization and business intelligence tool that allows you to connect to various data sources, transform and model the data, and create interactive reports and dashboards. Here are the basic steps involved in creating an interactive dashboard.

# 1.Data Collection and Preparation:
* Import your data into Power BI. You can connect to various data sources, including Excel files, databases, web services, and more.
* Clean and transform your data using the Power Query Editor to ensure it's in a suitable format for analysis.

# 2.Data Modeling:
* Define relationships between different data tables if your data comes from multiple sources.
* Create calculated columns and measures to perform calculations and aggregations on the data.

# 3.Data Visualization:
* Start building your dashboard by creating visualizations like charts, tables, and maps.
* Drag and drop fields from your data model onto the report canvas to create visuals.
* Customize the visuals by changing their formatting, colors, and styles.

# 4.Layout Design:
* Organize your visuals on the report canvas to create a logical layout.
* Use containers, grids, and sections to structure your dashboard.

# 5.Interactivity:
* Add slicers, filters, and drill-through actions to allow users to interact with the data. These elements enable users to focus on specific aspects of the data dynamically.
* Set up cross-filtering and highlighting interactions between visuals to make the dashboard responsive to user selections.

# 6.Dashboard Pages:
* Create multiple dashboard pages if needed to organize your visuals into different sections or topics.
* Use bookmarks to save the state of your dashboard and create a table of contents for navigation.

# 7.Visual-Level and Page-Level Filters:
* Apply filters at the visual and page level to control what data is displayed in each visual or on each page.

# 8.Publish and Share:
* Publish your report to the Power BI Service or Power BI Report Server.
* Share your dashboard with stakeholders by sharing a link or embedding it in a website.

# 9.Monitor Usage and Performance:
* Use the Power BI Service to monitor how users are interacting with your dashboard and analyze its performance.
